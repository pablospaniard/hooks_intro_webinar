# What Hooks are :question:

</Layout>

<Notes>

    Hooks are functions that let you use React state and lifecycle features from function components.

    Hooks don’t work inside classes — they let you use React without classes.

    Hooks become available since React 16.8 and React-Native 0.59 where released.

    https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html

## Before we continue, note that Hooks:

<List
  array={[
    '100% backwards-compatible.',
    'don’t replace your knowledge of React concepts.',
  ]}
/>

</Layout>

<Notes>

    1) Hooks don’t contain any breaking changes.

    2) Instead, Hooks provide a more direct API to the React concepts you already know: props, state, context, refs, and lifecycle.

## Motivation :muscle:

<List
  array={[
    'It’s hard to reuse stateful logic between components.',
    'Complex components become hard to understand.',
    'Classes confuse both people and machines.',
  ]}
/>

</Layout>

<Notes>

    Hooks solve a wide variety of problems in React that React core team encountered over five years.

    1) React doesn’t offer a way to “attach” reusable behavior to a component (for example, connecting it to a store).

    If you’ve worked with React for a while, you may be familiar with patterns like render props and higher-order components that try to solve this.

    But these patterns require you to restructure your components when you use them, which can be confused and make code harder to follow.

    If you look at a typical React application in React DevTools, you will likely find a “wrapper hell” of components surrounded by layers of providers, consumers, higher-order components, render props, and other abstractions.

    React needs a better primitive for sharing stateful logic.

    With Hooks, you can extract stateful logic from a component so it can be tested independently and reused.

    Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy.

    This makes it easy to share Hooks among many components or with the community.


    2)We’ve often had to maintain components that started out simple but grew into an unmanageable mess of stateful logic and side effects.

    Each lifecycle method often contains a mix of unrelated logic. For example, components might perform some data fetching in componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate.

    However, the same componentDidMount method might also contain some unrelated logic that sets up event listeners, with cleanup performed in componentWillUnmount.

    Mutually related code that changes together gets split apart, but completely unrelated code ends up combined in a single method.

    This makes it too easy to introduce bugs and inconsistencies. In many cases it’s not possible to break these components into smaller ones because the stateful logic is all over the place.

    It’s also difficult to test them. This is one of the reasons many people prefer to combine React with a separate state management library.

    However, that often introduces too much abstraction, requires you to jump between different files, and makes reusing components more difficult.

    To solve this, Hooks let you split one component into smaller functions based on what pieces are related (such as setting up a subscription or fetching data), rather than forcing a split based on lifecycle methods.

    You may also opt into managing the component’s local state with a reducer to make it more predictable.


    3)In addition to making code reuse and code organization more difficult classes can be a large barrier to learning React.

    You have to understand how this works in JavaScript, which is very different from how it works in most languages.

    You have to remember to bind the event handlers. Without unstable syntax proposals, the code is very verbose.

    People can understand props, state, and top-down data flow perfectly well but still struggle with classes.

    The distinction between function and class components in React and when to use each one leads to disagreements even between experienced React developers.

    Classes present issues for today’s tools, too. For example, classes don’t minify very well, and they make hot reloading flaky and unreliable.

    To solve these problems, Hooks let you use more of React’s features without classes.

    Conceptually, React components have always been closer to functions.

    Hooks embrace functions, but without sacrificing the practical spirit of React.

    Hooks provide access to imperative escape hatches and don’t require you to learn complex functional or reactive programming techniques.

## Rules of Hooks :point_up:

Hooks are JavaScript functions, but they impose two additional rules:

<List
  array={[
    'Only call Hooks at the top level. Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.',
    'Only call Hooks from React function components. Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions.',
  ]}
/>

</Layout>

<Notes>

    1) Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. Instead, always use Hooks at the top level of your React function.

    By following this rule, you ensure that Hooks are called in the same order each time a component renders.

    That’s what allows React to correctly preserve the state of Hooks between multiple useState and useEffect calls.


    2)  Instead, you can:

    - Call Hooks from React function components.

    - Call Hooks from custom Hooks.

    By following this rule, you ensure that all stateful logic in a component is clearly visible from its source code.

There is a linter plugin available to enforce these rules automatically.

    https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks

## How does React know which state corresponds to which useState call?

<CodeBlock code={hooks_order} />

</Layout>

<Notes>

The answer is that React relies on the order in which Hooks are called.

As long as the order of the Hook calls is the same between renders, React can associate some local state with each of them.

</Notes>

<Layout>

## Basic Hooks

- useState
- useEffect
- useContext

</Layout>

<Notes>

    1) Returns a stateful value, and a function to update it.

    During the initial render, the returned state is the same as the value passed as the first argument (initialState).

    The "Setter" function is used to update the state. It accepts a new state value and enqueues a re-render of the component.

    React guarantees that "Setter" function identity is stable and won’t change on re-renders. This is why it’s safe to omit from the useEffect or useCallback dependency list.

    If the new state is computed using the previous state, you can pass a function to setState. The function will receive the previous value, and return an updated value.


    2) Accepts a function that contains imperative, possibly effectful code.

    Mutations, subscriptions, timers, logging, and other side effects are not allowed inside the main body of a function component (referred to as React’s render phase).

    Doing so will lead to confusing bugs and inconsistencies in the UI.

    Instead, use useEffect. The function passed to useEffect will run after the render is committed to the screen.

    By default, effects run after every completed render, but you can choose to fire them only when certain values have changed.

    Although useEffect is deferred until after the browser has painted, it’s guaranteed to fire before any new renders.


    3) Accepts a context object (the value returned from React.createContext) and returns the current context value for that context.

    The current context value is determined by the value prop of the nearest Provider above the calling component in the tree.

    When the nearest Provider above the component updates, this Hook will trigger a rerender with the latest context value passed to that MyContext provider.

    Even if an ancestor uses React.memo or shouldComponentUpdate, a rerender will still happen starting at the component itself using useContext.

<Notes>

    1) An alternative to useState.

    Accepts a reducer, and returns the current state paired with a dispatch method. (If you’re familiar with Redux, you already know how this works.)

    useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.

    useReducer also lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.

    React guarantees that dispatch function identity is stable and won’t change on re-renders. This is why it’s safe to omit from the useEffect or useCallback dependency list.

    You can also create the initial state lazily. To do this, you can pass an init function as the third argument. The initial state will be set to init(initialArg).

    It lets you extract the logic for calculating the initial state outside the reducer. This is also handy for resetting the state later in response to an action.

    2) Returns a memoized callback.

    Pass an inline callback and an array of dependencies. useCallback will return a memoized version of the callback that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed.

    This is useful when passing callbacks to optimized child components that rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary renders (e.g. shouldComponentUpdate).

    3) Pass a function and an array of dependencies. useMemo will only recompute the memoized value when one of the dependencies has changed. This optimization helps to avoid expensive calculations on every render.

    Remember that the function passed to useMemo runs during rendering. Don’t do anything there that you wouldn’t normally do while rendering. For example, side effects belong in useEffect, not useMemo.

    If no array is provided, a new value will be computed on every render.

    4) useRef returns a mutable ref object whose .current property is initialized to the passed argument (initialValue). The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component.

    The only difference between useRef() and createRef() is that useRef will give you the same ref object on every render for lifecycle of the component.

## Custom Hooks

A custom Hook is a JavaScript function whose name starts with ”use” and that may call other Hooks.

A lot of great and useful examples => [Use Hooks](https://usehooks.com/)

</Layout>

<Notes>

    Building your own Hooks lets you extract component logic into reusable functions.

    1) Do I have to name my custom Hooks starting with “use”? Please do.

    This convention is very important. Without it, we wouldn’t be able to automatically check for violations of rules of Hooks because we couldn’t tell if a certain function contains calls to Hooks inside of it.

    2) Do two components using the same Hook share state?

    No. Custom Hooks are a mechanism to reuse stateful logic (such as setting up a subscription and remembering the current value), but every time you use a custom Hook, all state and effects inside of it are fully isolated.

    3) How does a custom Hook get isolated state?

    Each call to a Hook gets isolated state. Because we call useFriendStatus directly, from React’s point of view our component just calls useState and useEffect.

    And as we learned earlier, we can call useState and useEffect many times in one component, and they will be completely independent.
