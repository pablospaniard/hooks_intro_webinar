# What Hooks are :question:

<Notes>

    Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components.
    Hooks don’t work inside classes — they let you use React without classes.

    Hooks become available since React 16.8 and React-Native 0.59 where released. They let you use state and other
    React features without writing a class.

## Before we continue, note that Hooks:

<List
    array={[
        '100% backwards-compatible.',
        'don’t replace your knowledge of React concepts.',
    ]}
/>

<Notes>

    1) Hooks don’t contain any breaking changes.

    2) Instead, Hooks provide a
    more direct API to the React concepts you already know: props, state,
    context, refs, and lifecycle.

## Motivation :muscle:

<List
    array={[
        'It’s hard to reuse stateful logic between components.',
        'Complex components become hard to understand.',
        'Classes confuse both people and machines.',
    ]}
/>

<Notes>

    Hooks solve a wide variety of problems in React that React core team encountered over five years of writing and maintaining tens of thousands of components.

    1) React doesn’t offer a way to “attach” reusable behavior to a component (for example, connecting it to a store). If you’ve worked with React for a while, you may be familiar with patterns like render props and higher-order components that try to solve this. But these patterns require you to restructure your components when you use them, which can be cumbersome and make code harder to follow. If you look at a typical React application in React DevTools, you will likely find a “wrapper hell” of components surrounded by layers of providers, consumers, higher-order components, render props, and other abstractions. While we could filter them out in DevTools, this points to a deeper underlying problem: React needs a better primitive for sharing stateful logic.With Hooks, you can extract stateful logic from a component so it can be tested independently and reused. Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy. This makes it easy to share Hooks among many components or with the community.


    2)We’ve often had to maintain components that started out simple but grew into an unmanageable mess of stateful logic and side effects. Each lifecycle method often contains a mix of unrelated logic. For example, components might perform some data fetching in componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate. However, the same componentDidMount method might also contain some unrelated logic that sets up event listeners, with cleanup performed in componentWillUnmount. Mutually related code that changes together gets split apart, but completely unrelated code ends up combined in a single method. This makes it too easy to introduce bugs and inconsistencies.In many cases it’s not possible to break these components into smaller ones because the stateful logic is all over the place. It’s also difficult to test them. This is one of the reasons many people prefer to combine React with a separate state management library. However, that often introduces too much abstraction, requires you to jump between different files, and makes reusing components more difficult. To solve this, Hooks let you split one component into smaller functions based on what pieces are related (such as setting up a subscription or fetching data), rather than forcing a split based on lifecycle methods. You may also opt into managing the component’s local state with a reducer to make it more predictable.


    3)In addition to making code reuse and code organization more difficult, we’ve found that classes can be a large barrier to learning React. You have to understand how this works in JavaScript, which is very different from how it works in most languages. You have to remember to bind the event handlers. Without unstable syntax proposals, the code is very verbose. People can understand props, state, and top-down data flow perfectly well but still struggle with classes. The distinction between function and class components in React and when to use each one leads to disagreements even between experienced React developers. Additionally, React has been out for about five years, and we want to make sure it stays relevant in the next five years. As Svelte, Angular, Glimmer, and others show, ahead-of-time compilation of components has a lot of future potential. Especially if it’s not limited to templates. Recently, we’ve been experimenting with component folding using Prepack, and we’ve seen promising early results. However, we found that class components can encourage unintentional patterns that make these optimizations fall back to a slower path. Classes present issues for today’s tools, too. For example, classes don’t minify very well, and they make hot reloading flaky and unreliable. We want to present an API that makes it more likely for code to stay on the optimizable path. To solve these problems, Hooks let you use more of React’s features without classes. Conceptually, React components have always been closer to functions. Hooks embrace functions, but without sacrificing the practical spirit of React. Hooks provide access to imperative escape hatches and don’t require you to learn complex functional or reactive programming techniques.

## Rules of Hooks :point_up:

Hooks are JavaScript functions, but they impose two additional rules:

<List
    array={[
        'Only call Hooks at the top level. Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.',
        'Only call Hooks from React function components. Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions.',
    ]}
/>

<Notes>

    1) Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. Instead, always use Hooks at the top level of your React function.
    By following this rule, you ensure that Hooks are called in the same order each time a component renders.
    That’s what allows React to correctly preserve the state of Hooks between multiple useState and useEffect calls.
    (If you’re curious, we’ll explain this in depth below.)

    2)  Instead, you can:
    Call Hooks from React function components.
    Call Hooks from custom Hooks.

    By following this rule, you ensure that all stateful logic in a component is clearly visible from its source code.

    We provide a linter
    plugin to enforce these rules automatically. We understand these rules might
    seem limiting or confusing at first, but they are essential to making Hooks
    work well.

## How does React know which state corresponds to which useState call?

<CodeBlock style={{ fontSize: 28, width: '80vw' }} code={hooks_order} />

<Notes>
    The answer is that React relies on the order in which Hooks are called.

## Basic Hooks

-   useState
-   useEffect
-   useContext

---

<CodeBlock style={{ fontSize: 28, width: '80vw' }} code={basic_hooks} />

---

## Additional Hooks

-   useReducer
-   useCallback
-   useMemo
-   useRef
-   useImperativeHandle
-   useLayoutEffect
-   useDebugValue

---

## Additional Hooks

-   useReducer
-   useCallback
-   useMemo
-   useRef
-   ~~useImperativeHandle~~
-   ~~useLayoutEffect~~
-   ~~useDebugValue~~

---

<CodeBlock style={{ fontSize: 28, width: '80vw' }} code={add_hooks} />

---

## Custom Hooks

A custom Hook is a JavaScript function whose name starts with ”use” and that may call other Hooks.

A lot of great and useful examples => [Use Hooks](https://usehooks.com/)
